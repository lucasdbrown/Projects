This SQL project involves creating a database schema for managing employee information within an example organization. The project includes the definition of three main tables: `departments`, `roles`, and `employees`. It also establishes relationships between these tables using foreign keys. Additionally, primary keys and constraints are applied to ensure data integrity.

The project inserts sample data into the `departments` and `roles` tables, defining various departments and roles within the organization. The `employees` table is populated with the largest amount of data, including employee details such as name, department, role, hire date, and salary. The data insertion also reflects the hierarchy and structure within the organization. Created a bonus calculation function to find every employee's bonus based on an expected 10% of an employee's salary.
